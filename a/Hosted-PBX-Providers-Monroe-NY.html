<p>However cloud phone systems eliminate the PBX metaphor and instead settle for a various concept: Unified Communications (UC). Some functions, such as voicemail to text, are special to cloud-based phone systems. A micro-sized office might get by quickly with the bare-bones Office Pro setup, however the advanced functions of Office Pro Plus and Office Business are appealing for a couple of dollars more: the Nextiva mobile voice and video app and the Group Presence status sign (both included in Office Pro Plus) are useful upgrades, as are call recording and the number-meshing Nextiva Anyplace app (Office Enterprise).</p>
