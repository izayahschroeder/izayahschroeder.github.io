<p>VoIP phone service has been around for a long time as organisations and entrepreneurs change from telephone services that use PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) to a more advanced system. There is a huge variety of VoIP providers on the internet which supply SIP trunking (telephony services) for less expensive call rates than conventional telephone providers. The software and hardware is cost-effective, too, for VoIP phone systems.
