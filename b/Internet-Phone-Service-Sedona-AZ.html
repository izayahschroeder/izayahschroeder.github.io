<p>As we all know, VoIP is one of the hottest topics in the telecom market that has actually altered the method individuals consider interactions. A PBX system routes inbound calls to the appropriate extension in an office. Voice over IP converts your voice into a digital signal, compresses it, and sends it over the internet. Small and medium-sized services like yours require the exact same sophisticated and reliable interaction solutions as big companies do, but without the high costs or frustrating complexity. The development of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) in the early 2000s also caused the adoption of hosted VoIP, as this procedure enabled developers to bypass the constraints of hardware, producing applications that might integrate with practically any phone system.</p>
